# Hello, world

## Intro

My name is Eduardo. I am a classic sysadmin learning to use devops tools.

My main hobbist project is my [Linux Time Machine](https://github.com/elisboa/linux-time-machine.sh), totally written in Shell Script. When called via cron, it versions its files on a local and customized git repository. It supports remote repository pushing too.

Here are my other projects:

 - [main](https://github.com/elisboa/main) — here I store my personal settings, like vimrc, ssh config and so on 
 - [kubernetes](https://github.com/elisboa/kubernetes) — my basic kubernetes toolkit
 - [modo-aviao](https://github.com/elisboa/modo-aviao) — an incomplete and simple development guide for non-developers which simulates a fligth plane routine
 - [mytoolbox](https://github.com/elisboa/mytoolbox) — a simple Docker container which comes with some tools, as Ansible, Terraform and AWS CLI
 - [raspscripts](https://github.com/elisboa/raspscripts) — some simple scripts written for using  on a Raspberry Pi
 - [i3-cycle-workspace](https://github.com/elisboa/i3-cycle-workspace) — a simple tool that cycles a i3 workspace between displays
